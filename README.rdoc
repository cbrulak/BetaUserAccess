==Introduction

This is a simple gem to help limit alpha/beta/early access to a site or features of a site.

This gem is very early so please send any feedback via the issues page.

There is a demo project available on github: https://github.com/cbrulak/BetaUserAccessApp

I used the gem: rails3_engine_demo (https://github.com/krschacht/rails_3_engine_demo) as a basis for this gem.
